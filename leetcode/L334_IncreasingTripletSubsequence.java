    Given an unsorted array return whether an increasing subsequence of length 3 exists or not in the array.

Formally the function should:

Return true if there exists i, j, k
such that arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k] given 0 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n-1 else return false.
Note: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false

        int small = Integer.MAX_VALUE, big = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n <= small) { small = n; } // update small if n is smaller than both
            else if (n <= big) { big = n; } // update big only if greater than small but smaller than big
            else return true; // return if you find a number bigger than both
